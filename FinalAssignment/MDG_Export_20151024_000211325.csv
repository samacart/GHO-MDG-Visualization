Code, FootnoteText

Type, Name, Description
C,Country Data,"The figure is the one produced and disseminated by the country (including data adjusted BY THE COUNTRY to meet international standards)"
CA,Country Adjusted,"The figure is the one produced and provided by the country, but adjusted by the international agency for international comparability—that is to comply with internationally agreed standards, definitions and classifications (age group, ISCED, etc)"
E,Estimated,"The figure is estimated by the international agency, when corresponding country data on a specific year or set of years are not available, or when multiple sources exist, or there are issues of data quality.  Estimates are based on national data, such as surveys or administrative records, or other sources but on the same variable being estimated."
M,Modeled,"The figure is modeled by the agency when there is a complete lack of data on the variable being estimated. The model is based on a set of covariates—other variables for which data are available and that can explain the phenomenon."
G,Global monitoring data,"The figure is regularly produced by the designated agency for the global monitoring, based on country data. However, there is no corresponding figure at the country level, because the indicator is defined for international monitoring only (example: population below 1$ a day)"
N,Not Relevant,"The figure is not available because the indicator-as defined for the global monitoring-does not apply to the circumstances of the specific country, and therefore is not reported"
NA,Not Available,"A figure was not provided, or the "nature of data" - see other colors for the definition of "nature of data" - is unknown"
